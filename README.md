# Nexus Repository 

## Admin Password
The initial password for the admin user can be found in an admin.password file found in the $data-dir directory after starting the server.

## Configuring nexus as a npm repo
What we will do:
– create a private (hosted) repository for our own packages
– create a proxy repository pointing to the official registry
– create a group repository to provide all the above repos under a single URL
